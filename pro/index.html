            <h3>Basics of PinPoint Pro</h3>
            <p>
                PinPoint Pro is controlled through the menu item you will find at the top of your screen, next to some of the other built-in items from macOS. To call up its Settings Window or Quit PinPoint Pro, select the appropriate option from that menu.
            </p>

            <h3>Selecting Pointers</h3>
            <p>
                PinPoint Pro can display multiple effects at once. You select which effects are enabled by using the checkboxes next to each one.
                <br>
                Once selected, you can still toggle each one on or off by setting a Shortcut key or using the Action menu at the bottom of the list.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
            <p>
                To set a shortcut for each pointer, click on the pointer in the list, then set its Keyboard Equivalent at the bottom right of the Settings window.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also set multiple pointers to use the same Shortcut by assigning a first one to a pointer, then, for subsequent ones, select the name of the other pointer from the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                A shortcut can be set to Toggle a pointer when it is always visible, or simply turn it on until it disappears again automatically either because you moved it or after a delay.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Flipping between two pointers</h3>
            <p>
                When you tie two pointers to the same shortcut key, you can use the Action menu at the bottom of the list, to toggle one pointer separately. This allows you to toggle between two pointers using the same shortcut key.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the top of the settings window, you can select the Settings tab, which brings you to the settings which are not tied to any specific pointer. You will find quite a few useful options here.

                Masks
            </h3>
            <p>
                One layer type is called the Mask and it is different from the others in that it reverses the effect and cuts a hole out of a full-screen layer, to reveal only what is in the shape you choose.

                Layers
            </h3>
            <p>
                Each pointer effect is built of one or more layers. Each layer has its own characteristic and behaviour, which means you can build some intricate effects tailored to your needs.

            <h3>
                Advanced Layers
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways to use layers, probably too many to list here. So we built a tutorial which goes through many options. You will most certainly find novel ways to use them. Or find some impossible combinations…
                <p>
                </p>
                Most importantly, each layer has three types of possible controls:

                Related to how the layer stretches, follows the mouse or displays content (for steps)

            <h3>
                Displaying Steps
            </h3>
            <p>
                One type of layer allows you to display content on the screen. For example, this is useful to display extra information to your audience as you record your screencast. Another use is to display Keyboard presses to clarify what you are doing.
                <p>
                </p>
                For steps, you must have a Step type layer and set the contents in the Layout tab of the step. You can then display the next step, previous step or return to the first step by using the keyboard shortcuts set in the General tab.

            <p>
                The is a pre-made Keyboard Visualizer pointer, but you can add the same feature to your own pointer creation. There are a few options which should be self-explanatory.
