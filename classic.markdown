PinPoint is conveniently available from the menu bar at the top of your screen. It does however offer an option to be completely hidden, in which case it can still be controlled by double-clicking on its icon in your Applications folder.


## Useful pointers

Having fun is certainly important, but we also need to get things done. For this, PinPoint offers a series of pointers aimed at serious users. Whether you want your audience to follow along without losing the pointer, or perhaps to find the little bugger on one of your 6 monitors or perhaps simply because your eyesight is not what it used to be, there is most certainly a pointer just for you. If not, we’re open to suggestions!



## Crosshairs
